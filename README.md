# HoneyDoes App

## Description

We have recently built a mobile app for HoneyDoes LLC, a professional cleaning service based in Pittsburgh, Kansas, under the direction of Melissa Weed, the company's founder and CEO. This app caters to a wide range of users, including prospective and returning customers who require cleaning services for their homes, offices, rental properties, and more. Additionally, it offers functionality specifically designed for the cleaners and administration staff who work at HoneyDoes. The app distinguishes between these various roles, providing customized views for each.

The key features of this mobile app include user-friendly forms that consolidate and organize essential cleaning information. These forms enable prospective customers to submit their requirements and receive estimates for the cost of cleaning their desired space, streamlining the process and making it convenient for users. The app also incorporates a chat feature that facilitates seamless communication between administrators, cleaners, and clients, ensuring effective coordination and timely exchange of information.

Moreover, the app includes cleaner/administration/client dashboards, providing comprehensive access to job-related information. These dashboards offer an overview of both active and past jobs, enabling cleaners, administrators, and clients to stay updated on job status and details. Cleaners can manage their schedule effectively, accessing specific job details such as client names, locations, and cleaning requirements. Administrators benefit from monitoring and coordinating cleaning operations, viewing the status of all jobs, accessing client details, job histories, and specific instructions or preferences. Clients have their own dedicated dashboard, offering transparency and easy access to information about active and past jobs, including dates, estimated costs, and completed tasks.

Overall, the mobile app we have developed for HoneyDoes LLC is designed to enhance the user experience for both customers and staff. With intuitive forms, interactive chat functionality, and comprehensive dashboards, the app streamlines the cleaning service, fostering improved communication, efficient job management, and customer satisfaction.

## Getting Started

This project should be able to run in your favorite IDE. We used VS code while building it. 
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original-wordmark.svg" height="40px" width="40px" /></a>

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1. Fork this repository 
2. Copy the SSH key in your new repository
3. In your terminal type 'git clone {paste SSH link}'
4. Navigate into the repository's folder in your terminal
5. Open VS Code (or editor of your choice) and open the folder
6. In the terminal of VS Code run npm install to install all dependencies
7. Create a database named 'honey_does_app' (we used Postgres SQL).  If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change 'honey_does_app' to the name of your new database name in server/modules/pool.js
8. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables that you need, as well as a dummy data table to test the app. Copy and paste those queries in the SQL query of the database. If this is going to production, leave out the dummy data.
9. Run 'npm run server' in your VS Code terminal
10. Open a second terminal and run 'npm run client'

### Usage

Once everything is installed and running it should open in your default browser - if not, navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/.
